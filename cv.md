### About Me

I was engaged in the automation of business processes in financial institutions, support, automation of high-load systems, databases. At the age of 42, I decided to change my type of activity. I always gravitated towards visuals, so I began to study the desand principles of website design. I saw in the design clear stages of creating and structuring text and photo data to enhance the perceived effect of the interested audience. This path led to the layout, and after a couple of dozen types of sites, I realithat the result was not very bad. I want to develop further in the direction of the Frontend Developer. —
